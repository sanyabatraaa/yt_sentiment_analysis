@deric18roshan18,Can you use lofi pop for background music.
@HoneyComb1711,"coming back a year later to this, the day! I have done 500+ LC questions and also able to comfortably solve LC contests!"
@heybeachMIN,"Thank you for video! And specially thanks for site, really helpful! )"
@owenhochwald506,Would you need to check if the current word is in visited before starting the nested for loop?
@tyhjyydesta,"The most difficult part of this is problem was understanding why ""two words differing by one letter"" shouldn't include cases like arm -> farm, boat -> bat etc. and even more so: why this wasn't even worth mentioning in the solution. 

I am not a native English speaker and I was unfamiliar with the concept of ""word ladder games"". Yet the technical term of what the problem was going for is ""orthographic neighbor"" which is defined as ""A word that differs from another word of the same length by only one letter"". And since the definition explicitly states that the words need to be of the same length that implies that there is no general convention in English language that would mean ""differ by one letter"" implicitly assumes words are of the same length. 

Maybe the same length criteria in the problem context should be obvious to anyone familiar with the ""word ladder games"" (as chatgpt suggest it should), yet I also don't see reason why this couldn't be included explicitly in the definition of the problem. Shouldn't the leetcode problems be formulated in abstract mathematical and domain agnostic language? So that exact solution can be given without the necessity for asking additional questions?"
@juniper-salad,It's not worth it. You will be replaced by an H1B
@techenthusiast-q9n,"Great approach!, Thanks for sharing, it really makes the game a lot easier"
@jayjw1,"Overall your video is really positive and encouraging, but your friends that solved less than 100 LeetCode questions and are in FAANG either knew someone very close to them already working there, got extremely lucky, or practiced these types of questions on a different site as well.  I've interviewed with Amazon, Google, and a ton of other top tech companies for new grad roles (landed a nice one thankfully, *hard work does pay off eventually*), and the questions I was asked by 95% of these companies were LeetCode hards or tricky medium problems.  I also had a resume with some pretty impressive projects.  I do not know anyone in FAANG unfortunately though, so this is the route of just having to put my nose down and grind for 2-3 hours every morning for a year+.  No disrespect or hate to you or your videos, but you should definitely set more realistic expectations for viewers here.  The market is flooded right now."
@harshparadkar,"Great video though, leetcode is really about critical thinking and not mugging solutions"
@User-b1y9d,1:59 He actually said üòÆ word
@shihabahmed2809,people practise problem solving to understand pattern by themselves but if you are telling them then they are not learning.
@toocommonig,I'm cooked
@inmonolife8361,maybe GPT requires LeetCode?
@angelotheman,More on this please
@Mahamudul_Hasan_Sami,Can i code with JavaScript?

@timthegreatone,I'll come back one year later to this comment and be grateful I did not give up. Thanks for this video. Today is day 1

@GuRuGeorge03,"I once got the tip to write down a few cases by hand and then let my brain first do the work, if it can come up with the expected output. if yes, then it means my brain does know an actual algorithm that works, we just need to make it conscious. So first we try to follow what our brain did in simple english, after that we break down the simple english into atomic steps that can be written as code. Once you've done that, you almost always have the optimal algorithm, since our brains are actually genius at this stuff.

It's only really hard when you can't even explain an algorithm in simple english that will produce the correct output, then it's truly about finding and solving a base case first and working your way up to more compllicated cases."
@celeb_intel,"Wow, this video is a game-changer! I‚Äôve been struggling with LeetCode problems for a while, but the step-by-step approach you provided made everything so much clearer. The explanation of how to break down the problem and tackle it methodically is exactly what I needed. Thank you for simplifying a process that can feel overwhelming! üôå"
@NightwatchRebel,7:00 shortest path from beginword to nword is likely in the hood.
@Gamerlegend123-f3k,No one needs to master even one leetcode question. You can simply do one practice problem per day or week. Memorising how to solve a problem does not make you a software engineer
@Julio-re8em,idk this video kind of confused me a bit but thank you nonetheless for your guidance
@LionelMessia000,well the problem is im not even getting an interview offer to show off my leetcode skills god damn it
@unlucky-777,"It just 1 question per day, trust the progress and believe to yourself"
@DSASolutions,Useful ‚ù§
@jayrigger7508,"You start off with an insult ..  ""leetCode is the bane of wannabe engineers"".   Not being into code puzzles is not a sign of engineering skill."
@_bigthor,I've never done any leetcode problem and I haven't had any problem to get a job
@sureshdurairaj9316,Background music is annoying when using headphones. It‚Äôs distracting.
@kav04,Example of how to identify a pattern using Ad's website even makes it more vague and complicated
@mahmudulhasanx,"How f**king shits these videos are!! All you guys just need to learn a programming language and master in it and learn dsa concepts and practice and keep consistency 
That's it
These videos kind of scamüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
@amusicated,the link to the flowchart doesn't work for me unfortunately
@osc8468,"Thanks!
It seems your solution is not working, there is a Time Limit Exceeded but great explanation anyway."
@Everyday_smarter,nice solution
@sproutboot,Ha~ some questions sadly i dont get it even i see the solution and watch yt. Anyone has experienced same thing ?
@vulpritprooze,"Sh1t, we literally skipped data structures and algorithms last year in my 2nd year at college. We had the subject but we weren't even taught about it (we basically hovered over linked lists and big O notation the entire semester!). I thought it wasn't important and thought how easy the subject was. Turns out I missed a lot! Now it's time to study hard üò¢"
@lisaw7074,I just found your channel today and have watched a few of your videos. They are some of the best that I've ever seen when it comes to Leetcode prep with clear instructions and helpful tips. Thanks you so much for sharing these!
@yunagarnetsan,"I have a competition this Saturday and I've been asked to practice from leetcode. Let me tell you, I'm only a highschool student. The 'easy' question from leetcode take me a whole 30 mins to come up with an algorithm. I was told that I would be asked questions from medium and hard difficulties. With only 3 days left, I'm not sure of how much I would be able to prepare."
@ttt69420,"The problem people have with these questions is that they try or think they need to invent this algorithm (extremely difficult). When in reality the question is merely testng your almost rote knowledge of an already existing solution.

a truly unique answer requires a truly unique puzzle, and you just arent going to get that. These sites are learning tools not MENSA entrance exams."
@suryapratapsingh5046,Me who is grinding for a free t-shirt from leet code üòÇ
@FaberLSH,Thank you! but where is the wordList? I'm trying to run this code but I don't know what is the begin and the end word.
@Websitedr,I like the flowchart which makes more sense on how to systematically figure out which algorithm to use.
@adesai1000,"This feels super helpful, I used to feed discouraged to do DSA cause I used to think I knew how to solve it but wasn't able to code it. This helped me realized it is more than that"
@aniver987,U think you can make another video of what to learn before leetcoding
@valentinrafael9201,Perfect practice makes perfect indeed.
@AlienAndrew51,"Worked at several fortune 500s without learning advanced leetcode, can only solve the easy problems which is what is mostly required at most companies."
@Mubashir7933,"Maybe I'm dumb but what if I didn't understand question, what should I do?"
@Mubashir7933,you didn't show the solution of dog problem and lot was not possible and you straight jump into your own solution
@paragggoyal1552,just solve more problems
@doitwithghausiya2870,this is by far the nicest video I have ever watched.
@Alfakatt,I‚Äôve made a pretty good living never solving a leetcode in my life or even ever logged into the site
@Richa_cute,"So far I have only completed less than 20 problems. Will get back to this comment when I‚Äôve reached a century. üòä
I know one doesn‚Äôt need to solve that many but I‚Äôll taking a safety net so that I can also practice same kinda problems."
@mfgd-qo2yo,–±–∏–±–∏–∫—Å–æ–Ω–∞—Ñ  .
@shivamsiddharthasinghrajaw7671,these things come naturally when you've practiced enough
@0986rashmi,Am a big fan of algo monster easy to follow those templates
@bbmeireles,Nice tips. Very thanks.
@ItWasEnder,"Filthy Frank reference, the goat"
@Sulerhy,"I stoped video at :""My friends cracked FAANG with less than 100 solved LC problems"""
@ravirajac,Leetcode is used for cracking interviews. It has nothing to do with talent. Even a cab driver can do it if he puts some time and effort‚Äôs
@redfinance3403,That flowchart is genius!
@hossain9410,is it neccessary to have any achievements in coding competitions to land a job???
@1234victorxD,Dude im doing an interview in a week and you might made me land a job... You know what? if you did I will pay back to you and the community. See you in a week!
@haniissa1990,"from 2:32 , from dog ->lot I had to change two letters ? not one at the same time."
@haniissa1990,"I want to be sure , in 1:57 you try to change begin-word to the word in the word-List until to reach the  end-word"
@AdithyaRaj-dc9lv,Can ai solve these qns?
@Salah-YT,"Easy title, but why such a hard question, bro? You don't seem to care about beginners like me. You choose great content, but why explain such difficult problems? I couldn't even understand what you were talking about. Anyway, thanks."
@s8x.,wait i need this flowchart
@abhinavprabhakar455,Awesome! This video was very helpful. ‚ù§
@dhruvmishra3366,"Being consistent is really tough, especially when you're prepping for interviews. It's not just about putting hours in normal leetcode practice‚Äì you gotta dive into contests headfirst! Yeah, it's tough at the start, but trust me, it gets smoother. I use the CodingDude Chrome extension for tracking contests on various sites."
@yohahnribeiro6029,"Random observation, but in the slide that shows the final BFS solution, I think the code that checks if the new word is in the word list and not in the visited and not the word itself, needs to be indented to sit under the inner for loop?"
@electrode8773,Keep it up brother...I was one of those subscribers when you had started this channel..Its inspiring to see you grow..‚ù§‚ù§
@vectoralphaSec,Im not doing this shit.
@alex0917lfo,"At the first day of Leetcode , to be honest I felt I should give up. But 1 questions per day , 1 years later , I can pass 70% of easy and 40% medium. I even get an offer by passing 3 Leetcode questions with big bank company.  So my suggestion is keep practicing Leetcode like you playing a game!!"
@akshaychavan5511,"Everytime I wonder, why is this channel so underrated? ü§î"

@tuntumwakalasya5270,Is this question like bus routes the hard question ? Great video
@taradean.,thanks!
@anirudh6635,If problem solving is your hobby then leetcode is a great place to be at.
@nintendopro03,I hate how interviews force Leetcode questions. Super annoying. I couldn‚Äôt get through the first problem.
